![Microcks Testcontainers Spring demo](./assets/microcks-testcontainers-java-spring-demo.png)

This application is a demonstration on how to integrate Microcks via [Testcontainers]([https://www.testcontainers.com]) within your development inner-loop.

You will work with a Spring Boot application and explore how to:
* Use Microcks for provisioning third-party API mocks,
* Use Microcks for simulating external Kafka events publishers,
* Write tests using Microcks contract-testing features for both REST/OpenAPI based APIs and Events/AsyncAPI based messaging
